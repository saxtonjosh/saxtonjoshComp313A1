What is the main action in the game?
Moving, Jumping, Collecting crystals

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
The moving platform because I had no idea what I was doing when I started but now that I have a better understanding of timelines
I should be able to ue them more easily in the future

What is the most interesting part of the game?
The long presses for jumps and double jumps? It's not all that interesting if I was to do it again I would pick a different genre because I found using the tools
for 2d in unreal quite weird to use and couldn't just abuse the "tick for physics" boxes.
